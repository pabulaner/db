## Task 1: Aggregation and Manual Join

Manually implement the given queries in `bin/manualjoin.cpp` and `bin/aggregation.cpp`.

Build:
``` sh
make bin/manualjoin.out
```

Run:

``` sh
bin/manualjoin.out
```

Debug:

``` sh
gdb --args bin/manualjoin.out [arguments]
```

Performance build:

``` sh
make target=release bin/manualjoin.out
```

Compiling with variant flag as flag like VARIANT_tagged: (the flag is added to both the compiler and to the compiled query)
``` sh
make target=release variant=tagged bin/manualjoin.out
```
Also try `target=sanitize` to use the address sanitizer.
